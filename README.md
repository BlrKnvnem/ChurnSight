# 📉 ChurnSight: Telecom Customer Retention Analytics

**ChurnSight** is a data analysis project focused on understanding and reducing customer churn in the telecom industry. Using Python and pandas, this project explores customer behavior patterns, service usage, and contract details to extract actionable insights.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To analyze customer data from a telecom service provider and identify key factors that contribute to churn. This analysis helps build data-driven strategies for improving customer retention.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- 📄 **File**: `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`
- 📊 **Source**: IBM Sample Dataset
- 👥 **Records**: 7,043 customers
- 🔍 **Features**: Demographics, service plans, internet usage, payment methods, tenure, and churn label

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization
- (Optional: `scikit-learn` for churn prediction if modeling is added)

---

## 📈 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values and incorrect data types
   - Convert categorical variables where needed

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Univariate and bivariate analysis
   - Churn vs. customer features (tenure, contract type, payment method, etc.)
   - Visualization of churn rates across customer segments

3. **Insights**
   - Identify high-risk churn segments
   - Correlation between churn and contract/payment/internet service

4. *(Optional Future Step)*: Predictive modeling using Logistic Regression or Random Forest

## 📊 Sample Visuals

> Include screenshots or outputs from:
> - Churn rate bar graphs
> - Contract type vs. churn heatmap
> - Tenure distribution of churned vs retained customers

---

## 📌 Business Insights

- Month-to-month contracts and fiber-optic internet users show higher churn
- Customers with longer tenure are less likely to churn
- Auto-pay and longer-term contracts are associated with higher retention
